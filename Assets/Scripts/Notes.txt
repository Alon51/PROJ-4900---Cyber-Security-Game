If Ann wants to send a secret message to Matt, she will have to use some sort of technic to encrypt her message. 
Ann will use OTP encryption by following number of steps.

Assuming Ann would like to send the message: "Hello it is Ann". 
Let's see what she will have to do to use OTP succesfully.

Fitst: Ann will have to count how many letters she has in the sentence. As we can see, in this sentence we have 12 letters. 
Note  that the structure of the sentence will stay the same before and after the encryption.

Second: Ann will generate 12 random numbers to replace with each letter.
